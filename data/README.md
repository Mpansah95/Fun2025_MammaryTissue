## Data Source
The accession number, dog type, and other essential information about all the samples used in this study are detailed![below](https://github.com/Mpansah95/Fun2025_MammaryTissue/blob/main/images/Samples.png)

# Results

## Data Cleaning and Trimming
The results for quality control before and after trimming are shown below ![below](https://github.com/Mpansah95/Fun2025_MammaryTissue/blob/main/images/DataCleaningStats.png)

## Mapping statistics
The results below show the alignment statistics for the various samples used in this![study](https://github.com/Mpansah95/Fun2025_MammaryTissue/blob/main/images/MappingStats.png)

## Differential gene expression analysis

The results show a heatmap, sample-to-distance, Volcano Plot, and MA plot for the differential gene expression analysis using DESeq2

### Comparing DEGs by DESeq2 and Limma
The Upset plot below compares the number of differentially expressed genes in the two statistical models and shows the ![overlaps] (https://github.com/Mpansah95/Fun2025_MammaryTissue/blob/main/images/Limma%20vs%20DESeq2.png). 

### PCA plots samples
The plot below shows how the samples cluster and the ![variance](https://github.com/Mpansah95/Fun2025_MammaryTissue/blob/main/images/PCA.png)

### Gene set enrichment plots
The graph below shows the genes that are enriched in the ![IIS pathway](https://github.com/Mpansah95/Fun2025_MammaryTissue/blob/main/data/GSEA%20results/IIS_Mammary_Analysis2.GseaPreranked.1744289375119/enplot_IIS_PATHWAY_65.png)
